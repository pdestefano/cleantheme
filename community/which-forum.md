title: Which forum to use for communication
---

Developers need to efficiently discuss various topics such as issues,
usage quirks, new features, and documentation improvements.
Remember that other developers, the recipients of your messages, are also busy.
They also operate in different time zones. In such busy projects, items can
be easily overlooked, especially when in an inappropriate forum.
