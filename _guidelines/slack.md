- Real-time chat and messaging.

- Summarize topics out to other fora for better visibility.
  Remember that Slack is a secondary channel: significant ideas and
  decisions must be recorded elsewhere (Discuss, Wiki, Issues or GitHub)
  for broader vetting.

- Follow up on missed topics. This can occur when a flurry happens about
  other topics. Also everyone is busy, and may intend to respond later.
  So pursue topics at a later time or venue.

- A place to get together to solve a particular bug,
  or hold a brainstorming session,
  or to efficiently address a potential mis-understanding.
  Try to choose a time that suits people distributed around the world.

- A place for heads-up type of notices.
