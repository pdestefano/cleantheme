Go to the GitHub page, and it shows some recently pushed branches -- your one should
be there too. Next to it is a button "New pull request". Click on that.

If you are using a fork, then the process is a little different.
Start from your fork and select "New pull request", then select your
head fork and branch.

It should show that it is _able to merge_, so click on the "Create pull
request" button under the comment box.

If your pull request is instead to seek feedback, then say in the
description that it is not yet ready to merge. Describe the items for which
you want assistance.

After the pull request is created, assign it to someone else.
Alternatively leave it for someone to pick up.
